                    Butterflies are winged insects from the 
                    lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized 
                    by large, often brightly coloured wings that 
                    often fold together when at rest, and a 
                    conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group 
                    comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea 
                    (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and 
                    Papilionoidea (all others). The oldest 
                    butterfly fossils have been dated to the 
                    Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, 
                    though they likely originated in the Late 
                    Cretaceous, about 101 million years ago.[1]

                    Butterflies have a four-stage 
                    life cycle, and like other holometabolous 
                    insects they undergo complete 
                    metamorphosis. Winged adults lay eggs on 
                    the food plant on which their larvae, 
                    known as caterpillars, will feed. 
                    The caterpillars grow, sometimes very 
                    rapidly, and when fully developed, 
                    pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis 
                    is complete, the pupal skin splits, the 
                    adult insect climbs out, expands its wings 
                    to dry, and flies off.

                    Some butterflies, especially in 
                    the tropics, have several generations 
                    in a year, while others have a single 
                    generation, and a few in cold locations 
                    may take several years to pass through 
                    their entire life cycle.[citation needed]

                    Butterflies are often polymorphic, 
                    and many species make use of 
                    camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism 
                    to evade their predators.[2] Some, 
                    like the monarch and the painted 
                    lady, migrate over long distances. 
                    Many butterflies are attacked by 
                    parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, 
                    protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, 
                    or are preyed upon by other organisms. 
                    Some species are pests because in their 
                    larval stages they can damage domestic 
                    crops or trees; other species are agents 
                    of pollination of some plants. Larvae of 
                    a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat 
                    harmful insects, and a few are predators of 
                    ants, while others live as mutualists in 
                    association with ants. Culturally, butterflies 
                    are a popular motif in the visual and literary 
                    arts. The Smithsonian Institution says 
                    "butterflies are certainly one of the most 
                    appealing creatures in nature".[3]
